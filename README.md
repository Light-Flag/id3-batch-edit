# 🎵 Pseudo-Playlist

> Because my cheap MP3 player refuses to make playlists.

## What is this?

Pseudo-Playlist is a tiny Python tool that edits your MP3 album tags to **simulate playlists** on cheap MP3 players.

## Why I Made It

Some MP3 players are stubborn.  
They don’t allow me to make playlists, but they have "artists" and "album" sections.  
So I took matters into my own hands using Python and [Mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Now my Japanese and English songs live happily in their own "albums"

## How To Use

1. Put all your MP3 files in one folder.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python batch_album.py

3. Choose the album name you want (e.g., "Chill" or "Pop").
4. Your songs are now “organized” like a playlist! 🎉
